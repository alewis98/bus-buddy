## Project Overview

The best Transloc bus app

Integrated with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant

## What Can Bus Buddy Do For Me

Well, that depends. Bus Buddy works for all bus agencies that use Transloc. See the list of agencies [here](http://translocrider.com/our-agencies). 

If you don't use Transloc, your're out of luck bud.

If you do use Transloc, Bus Buddy can...
- Tell you when the next bus is coming
- Tell you when the bus after that is coming
- Tell you when the bus after that is coming
- Tell you when the bus after that is coming
- Tell you what stop the next bus is at (because Transloc's time predictions are never wrong) 


## Usage

- "ask Bus Buddy when's the Purple Line coming" 
- "ask Bus Buddy when is the next Inner U-Loop"
- "ask Bus Buddy when will the Northline arrive at Barracks"
- "ask Bus Buddy where's the next Red Line"
- "ask Bus Buddy where is the Outer U-Loop heaing towards Gooch-Dillard"
